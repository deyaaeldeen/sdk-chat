Test package demonstrating scenarios where source-based extraction fails.

SOURCE LIMITATION: The __all__ list below is computed dynamically at runtime.
The AST parser sees `__all__ = _build_all()` but cannot evaluate _build_all()
because it doesn't execute code — it just parses syntax trees. So it cannot
determine which symbols are public.

COMPILED (inspect): importlib.import_module() executes this code, then
getattr(mod, '__all__') returns the resolved list ["ServiceClient", "ServiceConfig",
"ServiceError"]. 100% accurate public API.
